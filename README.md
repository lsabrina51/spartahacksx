<h1>SuperegoAI</h1>
<p>Ever wish you had a little voice guiding you through life? Well, now you do—except this one can’t make up its mind. Meet SuperegoAi, your personal AI companion with a split personality!

This project is inspired by Freud’s superego and id—or as we like to call them, the angel and devil on your shoulder—this chatbot listens to whatever you say and randomly chooses whether to lift you up or tear you down.

Feeling down? Maybe the angel will swoop in with words of comfort and wisdom. Too confident? The devil might just humble you in the most demeaning way possible. It’s all up to fate (and a random number generator). Expect pure, unpredictable chaos—sometimes uplifting, sometime sarcastically honest, but always hilarious.</p>
